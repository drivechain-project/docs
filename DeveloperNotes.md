# Developer Notes
This is just a rough draft, there is much more to be added.

To see the rest of the documentation for the Drivechain project:

## Language used in Drivechains project:

### `Mainchain`
https://github.com/drivechain-project/bitcoin/tree/mainchainBMM

The mainchain is Bitcoin, with added functionality to support Drivechains. The work that is intended to
be merged upstream all goes into the mainchain branch of the Bitcoin fork in this repository.

### `Sidechain`
https://github.com/drivechain-project/bitcoin/tree/sidechainBMM

The sidechain is a fork of Bitcoin, with added functionality to support the sidechain half of Drivechains.
This code doesn't ever need to be merged into Bitcoin upstream.

### `BMM`
'BMM' stands for blind merged mining which is how Drivechains use the PoW of the Bitcoin mainchain. Refer
to http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/blind-merged-mining/ for more information.

### `SCDB`
`SCDB` is short for Sidechain Database. The SCDB keeps track of the work score
of WT^(s) for each sidechain during the current Tau as well as BMM linking data.

### `wt`
`wt` is the name given to an individual withdrawal attempt from the sidechain back to the mainchain.

### `WT^`
`WT^` is the name given to a transaction created by the sidechain that joins pending wt's
into a single transaction that can be verified by the mainchain.

### `B-WT^`
`B-WT^` is the blinded version (no inputs) of a WT^ that is voted on. Once a B-WT^ has 
sufficient workscore the WT^ with inputs will be created. The WT^ can be verified by 
blinding it again.

### `Tau` &tau; 
`Tau` is used to represent a single round / period of waiting and verification for an individual sidechain.
The Tau of the testing sidechain (SIDECHAIN_TEST) is 300 for example. The Tau is calculated by the 
sidechain.GetTau() function in the following way: `return (sidechain.nWaitPeriod + sidechain.nVerificationPeriod);`

During the Tau of a particular sidechain, up to MAX_SIDECHAIN_WTS (3 for now) may be added to SCDB for verification.
Each sidechain has space for up to MAX_SIDECHAIN_WTS during any single Tau. Note that the Tau for each sidechain may
be different. After the waiting period portion of the Tau, miners may begin verifying the WT^(s) submitted. At the end
of a sidechain Tau, if a WT^ has been verified such that it has sufficient workscore it will be paid out on the mainchain.
At the beginning of the next Tau, the SCDB is blank for that sidechain until a new WT^ is shown to the miners. The SCDB 
is amnesic to previous Tau periods.

         "hashWTPrime":id,       (string,  required) The WT^ hash
         "workscore":n           (numeric, required) The updated workscore
       } 
       ,...
     ]

 (code -1)
 
 receivewtprimeupdate 10 '[{"sidechainnumber": '1', "hashWTPrime": "'3366e8825f6c0d6da7c870c1ab6b035e1ef1610a6d1e7d7afb972a169c4c648a'", "workscore": '1'}]'
 
```

## More information:

### Maximum number of valid sidechains:
Each sidechain is assigned a unique number, represented by an 8 bit unsigned integer.
This limits the maximum number of sidechains to 256.

### Known issues and improvements to be made:
